## The Offensive GRE

Have you ever thought about memorizing the GRE vocabulary, but all you 
could think about was tearing those flashcards into tiny bits that 
wouldn't bother you throughout the day with dry AF examples?

Well, we did too. The GRE is a pretty important exam and is essentially
a gatekeeper to education that one must surmount to get further in life. 
Learning the GRE vocabulary is taxing and tiring when you flip through
those ordinary flashcards, and you can feel your brain going dull at times.
However, and this is a big thing, it doesn't have to be as banal and 
insipid as it is. 

This is where the Offensive GRE comes into play. We have terrible examples
that borderline suck, but at least they wouldn't bore you to death. Give it
a shot!

## Contributing

This project is open for contribution, but the functionality is not yet 
so, since this is an academic project as much as an open source one until
we're done with the core functionality. 

Please do feel free to pitch in with your own JSON card decks in the 
`data/` folder in the `backend/` directory though!

The format of the data that we'll be needing is as follows,
```JSON
{
  "word": "quixotic",
  "definition": "capricious or impulsive",
  "example": "No Nut November is a quixotic pipe dream, you'll never make it!"
}
```
