## GreVerb

The `greverb` that seeks to provide you with an interface which allows 
you to test your might against GRE Vocabulary. This is a WIP, but there's 
high hopes for the future.

## Task List

There are quite the few features that the current model of the `greverb`
lack, some of the features that we're currently considering and are vital
towards the development of the project are,

- [ ] Implementation of a GRE Quizzing Mechanism.
- [ ] Set up of Custom Card Quizzing Functionality.
- [ ] Adding in the cards in the form of JSON data.
- [ ] Designing a front-end for the application.

## Contributing

This project is open for contribution, but the functionality is not yet 
so, since this is an academic project as much as an open source one until
we're done with the core functionality. 

Please do feel free to pitch in with your own JSON card decks in the 
`data/` folder in the `backend/` directory though!

The format of the data that we'll be needing is as follows,
```JSON
{
  "word": "quixotic",
  "definition": "capricious or impulsive",
  "example": "No Nut November is a quixotic pipe dream, you'll never make it!"
}
```
